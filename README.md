# Carbonless Theme for EmulationStation

Carbonless is a relatively up-to-date fork of [fabricecaruso/es-theme-carbon](https://github.com/fabricecaruso/es-theme-carbon), with the following changes.

* Updated gamelist with less metadata, hence "Carbonless".
* Replaced game icon with a transparent image.
* Added arcade-classis and dkong systems.
* Improved images for arcade, daphne, ecwolf, retrobat, tg-cd, and tg16 systems.
* Maintained carousel, center fade, and system info on tiny screens.
* Removed delay for displaying system from Legacy view.
